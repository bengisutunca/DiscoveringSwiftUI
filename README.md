# 🚀 Discovering SwiftUI

## 📝 Description
Welcome to the **Discovering SwiftUI** repository. This repository is dedicated to hosting example projects from the [HackingWithSwift SwiftUI courses](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). As I continue to learn and master SwiftUI, I'll be adding various projects here to showcase different aspects and capabilities of SwiftUI.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document and share my journey of learning SwiftUI through the HackingWithSwift courses. By working through various example projects, I aim to:

1. Enhance my understanding of SwiftUI and its capabilities.
2. Develop practical skills in building SwiftUI applications.
3. Explore best practices and advanced techniques in SwiftUI development.
4. Create a comprehensive collection of example projects that can serve as a resource for others learning SwiftUI.
5. Track my progress and reflect on my learning journey.

### 📚 This repository will continue to evolve with new projects and improvements as I progress through the courses and deepen my understanding of SwiftUI.
